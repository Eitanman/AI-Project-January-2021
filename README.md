# AI-Project-January-2021
In the different segments I built a program that takes a “train group” of casefiles, data about different patients and whether or not they have Covid,
train a program that based on the train group is supposed to project the diagnosis for future patients, then we test it on the test group and return the success rate. 
The code is in Python, uses Panda and uses algorithms such as Decision Trees, ID3, KNN Forest, Decision by Committee. The PDF (with the instructions) is also attached as well
as the Test and Train files and the “main” file to run each segment.
